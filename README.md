# Week-5---Know-Your-Brand

The file contains the examples and code from 5.3.3 and 5.3.4 on Canvas introducing SQL to Python. Some of my answers are slightly different to those on Canvas, i attempted my own way first before sometimes correcting to the final answer (or not if i disagreed with it ;))

Thanks for reading!
